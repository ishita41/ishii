            <p>
                <b>AidSquad is a volunteer based, zero-funds organization that works to get surplus food from
                    restaurants
                    and the community to serve less fortunate people. The idea is to create self-sustained chapters
                    across
                    the world who will look after their local community. And in the process, inspire people around us to
                    give back to those who need it most.</b>

                    <p class="center">Food loss and waste is a major part of the impact of agriculture on climate change
                        and other environmental issues. . Moreover, food waste that is not handled or reclaimed
                        properly, i.e. through composting, can have many negative environmental consequences.

                    <p class="center">Everybody wants to help poor people, but when they think about the huge amount of
                        money one has to spend for a cause, many of them fail to come forward. With ‘AidSquad’ , anybody
                        can help a poor person.We hope that no poor person would go to sleep hungry anywhere in the
                        country.
